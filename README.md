# TaskTracker (WPF version)

TrackTracker is the simple start for an application that will track my daily
tasks and act as a Digital Bullet Journal to track my life and daily activities.

The initial version includes only task tracking with the ability to add daily
tasks automatically, based on a list of repeating tasks. Tasks can repeat every
day, on weekdays, weekends, or only certain days (i.e. Monday, Wednesday, Friday).

The user interface is implemented as a WPF application with MongoDB as the data
source. The program is written in C# using .NET 7.
